# MonopolySim

- In light of the final project for MSCA32010 (Linear Algebra) at the University of Chicago, I attempted to build a simulation of the Monopoly game.
- The simulation emulates a real game of Monopoly where players roll die, land on spaces, choose to buy properties, pay/collect rents, pick up cards, etc.
- The goal of this endeavour is to simulate many iterations of Monopoly and compare the results to that obtained by the final project
